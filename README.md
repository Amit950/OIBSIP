# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains the code and resources for various data science projects that I have worked on.

## Project 1: Iris Flower Classification

In this project, I have implemented a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal measurements. The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used for classification tasks in machine learning. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that cover data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Project 2: Car Price Prediction

The Car Price Prediction project focuses on predicting the price of a car based on various factors such as brand, features, horsepower, and mileage. I have trained a machine learning model using a dataset containing information about different cars. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that guide you through the process of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Project 3: Unemployment Analysis

The Unemployment Analysis project involves analyzing unemployment data to gain insights into employment trends and patterns. I have used a dataset containing historical unemployment rates for different regions and time periods. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that explore the dataset, perform data visualization, and derive meaningful insights from the data.

Feel free to explore the code and resources provided for each project. Each project is organized into its own directory, containing the necessary data files, notebooks, and scripts. You can navigate to each project's directory to find more details and instructions on how to run the code.

Please note that these projects are for educational and demonstration purposes, showcasing my skills and knowledge in data science and machine learning.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out. Happy exploring!
